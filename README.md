# uAgent Projects - SMS Notifications and Two-Agent Communication 🚀🤖

This repository contains two distinct projects demonstrating different uAgent functionalities. Each project serves a specific purpose and showcases the capabilities of uAgents.

## Project 1: SMS Notification Agent 📲

The SMS Notification Agent project focuses on sending SMS notifications based on temperature readings. It uses the uAgents framework to monitor temperature and notify users via SMS when specific conditions are met.

**Features:**
- Temperature monitoring in a selected location.
- SMS notifications using the Sinch SMS API.
- Environment variable setup for API keys.

For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the [SMS Notification Agent README](https://github.com/mrbhatt2348/Fetch.ai-Hackathon-Project/tree/main/SMS-Notification-with-uagent).

## Project 2: Two-Agent Communication 🤖🤝

The Two-Agent Communication project illustrates how two uAgents, a Temperature Monitoring Agent and another agent (Bob), can communicate remotely. When the temperature changes in the selected location, the Temperature Monitoring Agent notifies Bob, demonstrating remote agent communication.

**Features:**
- Temperature monitoring and notification to another agent.
- uAgent setup for remote communication.
- Configurable temperature thresholds.

For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the [Two-Agent Communication README](https://github.com/mrbhatt2348/Fetch.ai-Hackathon-Project/tree/main/Communication_between_2_uagents).

Choose the project that interests you or explore both to leverage uAgents for various use cases.

Happy coding and experimenting with uAgents! 🚀🤖
