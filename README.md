# uAgent Projects - Temperature Monitoring Agent (2 implementations) 🚀🤖 

The main theme of this project is that, the user gets the capability of monitoring the temperature in his/her selected city, and the temperature range in that city, if the temperature falls below the minimum temperature specified by the user, or the temperature rises above the maximum temperature specified by the user, the user gets notified. Here I have implemented the given theme in 2 different ways, in the first one the user gets the notification by a sms in their mobile phones and in the later one the user which is in fact an other uagent, gets notified on a remote communication server. 
This repository contains two distinct projects demonstrating different uAgent functionalities. Each project serves a specific purpose and showcases the capabilities of uAgents.

## Project 1: Temperature Agent which notifies user by a SMS in their mobile phones📲

The SMS Notification Agent project focuses on sending SMS notifications based on temperature readings. It uses the uAgents framework to monitor temperature and notify users via SMS when specific conditions are met.

**Features:**
- Temperature monitoring in a selected location.
- SMS notifications using the Sinch SMS API.
- Environment variable setup for API keys.

For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the [SMS Notification Agent README](https://github.com/mrbhatt2348/Fetch.ai-Hackathon-Project/tree/main/SMS-Notification-with-uagent).

## Project 2: Temperature Agent which notifies another uagent in a remote communication channel📲 🤖🤝

The Two-Agent Communication project illustrates how two uAgents, a Temperature Monitoring Agent and another agent (Bob), can communicate remotely. When the temperature changes in the selected location, the Temperature Monitoring Agent notifies Bob, demonstrating remote agent communication.

**Features:**
- Temperature monitoring and notification to another agent.
- uAgent setup for remote communication.
- Configurable temperature thresholds.

For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the [Two-Agent Communication README](https://github.com/mrbhatt2348/Fetch.ai-Hackathon-Project/tree/main/Communication_between_2_uagents).

Choose the project that interests you or explore both to leverage uAgents for various use cases.

Happy coding and experimenting with uAgents! 🚀🤖
